## üåê Projects

- **Pneumonia Detection Using Neural Networks**:
"Pneumonia Detection Using Neural Networks" is a pivotal project that utilizes the power of deep learning to identify the presence of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The initiative leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) renowned for their efficacy in image analysis tasks. The model was trained on a robust dataset comprising both normal and pneumonia-affected X-ray scans. Through a series of convolutional layers, pooling, and dense layers, the neural network effectively learned the distinguishing features of pneumonia in the scans. With the aid of data augmentation and fine-tuning, the model achieved impressive accuracy, paving the way for potential applications in rapid diagnostic tools and providing healthcare professionals with a valuable second opinion. This project underscores the potential of AI in revolutionizing medical diagnostics and the importance of accurate and early detection in improving patient outcomes.
- **Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews**:
  This project delves into the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to gauge the emotions and sentiments expressed in movie critiques. Utilizing a rich dataset of movie reviews from IMDb, the project employs advanced machine learning algorithms to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. By processing textual data, tokenizing, and vectorizing reviews, the model effectively captures the essence and nuances of each review. Several techniques, including word embeddings, were experimented with to enhance the model's accuracy. The end result is an intelligent system capable of automatically determining the sentiment of a given movie review. This project not only showcases the power of NLP in understanding human emotions in textual data but also offers valuable insights for the entertainment industry to gauge audience reception of movies.
- **Multi-Class Multi-Label Text Classification**:
  This project is an advanced machine learning endeavor aimed at categorizing textual data into multiple predefined categories, with the potential for each piece of text to belong to multiple categories simultaneously. Drawing from a comprehensive dataset, this project involved preprocessing and vectorizing text to prepare it for model training. Leveraging techniques such as word embeddings and deep learning architectures, the model is trained to recognize patterns that indicate multiple labels. This project demonstrates the depth of classification tasks in NLP and the importance of accommodating the multifaceted nature of textual information.
